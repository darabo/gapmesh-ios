# Gap User Guide

[**فارسی (Read in Farsi)**](USER_GUIDE_FA.md)

Welcome to Gap! This guide will help you understand how to set up and use the Gap messaging app on your iOS or Android device.

## What is Gap?

Gap is a special messaging app designed to keep you connected even when the internet is down. It uses two ways to send messages:

1.  **Offline (Bluetooth):** Sends messages directly to people nearby (within about 30 feet or 10 meters) without using the internet or cell service. These messages can hop from phone to phone to reach people further away.
2.  **Online (Internet):** When you have internet, Gap connects to global servers (relays) to let you chat with people in your city or neighborhood.

**Key Features:**
*   **No Accounts:** You don't need a phone number or email. Just pick a nickname.
*   **Private:** Messages are encrypted.
*   **Resilient:** Works during internet blackouts using Bluetooth.
*   **Emergency Wipe:** Quickly delete all your data if needed.

## Getting Started

When you open Gap for the first time, you will need to grant a few permissions. These are essential for the app to work.

### 1. Permissions
*   **Bluetooth:** **REQUIRED**. This allows the app to find and chat with nearby devices offline.
*   **Location:** **REQUIRED**. Gap uses your general location to put you in a chat channel with people in your city or neighborhood. It does *not* track your exact movements.
*   **Notifications:** Recommended. Lets you know when you get a new message.

### 2. Create Your Profile
1.  You will be asked to choose a **Nickname**. This is how others will see you.
2.  That's it! No passwords or codes to remember.

## How to Use Gap

### The Main Screen
The main screen shows your chat channels. You might see names like:
*   `mesh #bluetooth`: This is for **offline** chat with people nearby.
*   `city #...`: This is for **online** chat with people in your city.
*   `neighborhood #...`: This is for **online** chat with people in your immediate area.

### Chatting Offline (Mesh)
1.  Tap on the **`mesh`** channel.
2.  Type your message and hit send.
3.  Anyone nearby with the app will see it.
4.  **Note:** This works like a walkie-talkie. It's a public room for everyone nearby.

### Chatting Online (Location)
1.  Tap on a **`city`** or **`neighborhood`** channel.
2.  These channels only work when you have an internet connection.
3.  Messages here reach anyone in that location who is also online.

### Private Messages (DMs)
You can send private messages to specific people.
1.  Tap on a user's name in a chat room.
2.  Select **Message** or **Private Chat**.
3.  These messages are encrypted, meaning only you and the recipient can read them.

### Verifying Identity (Security)
To be sure you are talking to the right person (and not an imposter), you can verify their "Fingerprint".
1.  Tap the user's name to see their profile.
2.  You will see a colorful pattern or a code (Fingerprint).
3.  Compare this code with the one on their phone screen (in person or via another secure channel).
4.  If they match, mark them as **Verified**.

## Emergency Features

### Panic / Wipe Data
If you are in a dangerous situation and need to hide your activity:
*   **Triple-tap** (tap 3 times fast) on the bottom tab bar or the main header (depending on your specific version).
*   This will **instantly delete all messages and contacts** from your phone.
*   **Warning:** This cannot be undone.

## Tips for Best Performance

*   **Bluetooth Range:** Keep devices within about 30 feet (10 meters) for offline chat. Walls can reduce this range.
*   **Battery:** The app is designed to be battery-efficient, but keeping Bluetooth active all day can use some power.
*   **The "Mesh":** The more people use the app nearby, the better it works! Messages can "hop" up to 7 times between devices to travel further.

## Troubleshooting

*   **"I can't see anyone nearby"**:
    *   Make sure both you and your friend have **Bluetooth ON**.
    *   Ensure you both gave the app **Bluetooth permissions** in your phone settings.
    *   Try moving closer together.
*   **"Messages aren't sending"**:
    *   If you are in a `city` channel, check your internet connection.
    *   If you are in `mesh`, check if anyone is within range.
